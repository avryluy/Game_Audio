# Avry Luy's ReaScripts for [REAPER](https://reaper.fm)
These are scripts I've developed to provide additional functionality while working in REAPER.



## Included Scripts

- Playback\aluy_Toggle_Halfspeed_Playback_Play_Stop: Plays at 50% speed. Stops and resets playrate back to 100%


## Manual Download Instructions (Optional)
If you would prefer to download the scripts here manually, you can click on "Clone or Download". It's recommended that you place them within <AppData\Roaming\REAPER\Scripts\>, as they will get included whenever you export or backup your Reaper configuration.
